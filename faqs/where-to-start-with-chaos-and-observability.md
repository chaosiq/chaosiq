# If teams are new to chaos engineering and observability, where should they start?

All roads tend to start with the [Principles of Chaos](https://principlesofchaos.org/).

From there, we'd suggest grabbing the [Chaos Toolkit](https://chaostoolkit.org/), working through some [online tutorials](https://katacoda.com/chaostoolkit), and getting stuck in to creating some chaos experiments of your own. This will lead you almost immediately to question your own system's observability, and then grabbing a copy of the [Distributed Systems Observability](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/distributed-systems-observability/9781492033431/) and [Chaos Engineering](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/chaos-engineering/9781491988459/) books would be great next steps.

Finally there are also a few great communities that you can join to compare notes and get lots of free advice. There is the [Chaos Communitiy on Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/chaos-community), [Gremlin's Chaos Engineering Community on Slack](https://slofile.com/slack/chaosengineering) and, for those using the Chaos Toolkit and Platform, [our team and community Slack as well](https://join.chaostoolkit.org/).

Chaos engineering is an exciting journey towards building trust and confidence in your systems that never really stops. These communities are there to help you get going and keep going as we all see chaos engineering as being a key mindset and discipline to helping us all build more robust, resilient and, ultimately, reliable, safe and secure systems.
